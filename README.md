Static Dynamic Stacks 
July, 2023
– Implemented stacks using static memory (arrays having maximum capacity) as well as dynamic memory.
– The dynamic memory implementation involved an optimized approach using Hysteresis to resize the arrays.


• Hashing 
August, 2023
– Implemented chaining and linear, quadratic and cubic probing through arrays and optimal resizing techniques.
– The program can manage 100,000 different Bank Accounts consisting of ID and balance with minimum collisions.
- Functions such as add money, withdraw money, get top K balances, etc., were also implemented for each hashmap.

  
• Expression Evaluator 
September, 2023
– Implemented unlimited range rationals and implemented basic arithmetic operations using vector and strings.
– Created an expression tree and using BST, implemented a symbol table which stored the symbols and their values.


• Compiler for Simple Expressions 
September, 2023
– Created a compiler for a language of arithmetic expressions and generated a command file to run it on machine.
– AVL Tree is generated for parsing a given set of queries and printed on command file using post-order traversal.


• Document Processing Tool 
September, 2023
– Using Red-Black Trees to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given set of books acting as corpus.
– Using Rabin-Karp algorithm, search all the occurrences of a given string and return book, page, para, line, offset.


• Corpus QnA Tool 
October, 2023
– Paragraphs were rated according to the presence of each word in the question statement using BM25 Algorithm.
– The top 6 paragraphs were then fed into ChatGPT. Prompt Engineering was used to design the LLM Prompt
using root prompting, persona pattern and prompt size limitations.
