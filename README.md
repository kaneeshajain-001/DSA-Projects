Static Dynamic Stacks – Implemented stacks using static memory (arrays having maximum capacity) as well as dynamic memory. The dynamic memory implementation involved an optimized approach using Hysteresis to resize the arrays.


Hashing – Implemented chaining and linear, quadratic and cubic probing through arrays and optimal resizing techniques. The program can manage 100,000 different Bank Accounts consisting of ID and balance with minimum collisions. Functions such as add money, withdraw money, get top K balances, etc., were also implemented for each hashmap.

  
Expression Evaluator – Implemented unlimited range rationals and implemented basic arithmetic operations using vector and strings. Created an expression tree and using BST, implemented a symbol table which stored the symbols and their values.


Compiler for Simple Expressions – Created a compiler for a language of arithmetic expressions and generated a command file to run it on machine. AVL Tree is generated for parsing a given set of queries and printed on command file using post-order traversal.


Document Processing Tool – Using Red-Black Trees to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given set of books acting as corpus. Using Rabin-Karp algorithm, search all the occurrences of a given string and return book, page, para, line, offset.


Corpus QnA Tool – Paragraphs were rated according to the presence of each word in the question statement using BM25 Algorithm. The top 6 paragraphs were then fed into ChatGPT. Prompt Engineering was used to design the LLM Prompt using root prompting, persona pattern and prompt size limitations.
